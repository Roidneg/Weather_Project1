# Weather_Project1
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for analyzing weather data, focusing on exploring various weather patterns and performing data visualization.
Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze a weather dataset, examining patterns in temperature, humidity, and other weather metrics. Through data analysis and visualization techniques, we aim to gain insights into seasonal changes, correlations between different weather factors, and trends over time.
Files in this Repository
